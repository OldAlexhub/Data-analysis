        Analysis of Socio-Economics of Egypt from 1990 through 2019
      </h1>
      <h2 className="text-center mb-3">By: Mohamed Gad</h2>
      <p>
        As we exit 2023, the world is ablaze with the Russian war on Ukraine in
        the north, the Israeli occupation's genocide against the people of
        Palestine in Gaza at the center, and tensions between China and Taiwan
        in the Far East, upsetting the United States in the Far West.
        Additionally, the United States faces its own political and economic
        disasters. This concoction is far from what is considered normal. In
        South America, countries still suffer from the aftermath of old-time
        imperialism and current political corruption, "Viva la Che.". Central
        America hosts nations like Mexico and Panama, the latter being a haven
        for corrupt money. The U.S. territories scattered across Central America
        are treated like stepchildren, in a very weird relationship. Europe, the
        old continent, lacks energy and humans as its birth rate declines for
        reasons I won't discuss here. England is still grappling with the
        consequences of Brexit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at my intro, I have discovered that the only content that isn’t
        really involved in the world scene of political affairs is the old good
        Mama Africa. Looking into Africa and seeing the civil war in North Sudan
        and the North- South Sudanese conflicts and the Ethiopian political and
        societal division that has a sleeping destroyer called grand civil war.
        Also looking at Libya with its funny and not funny situation. While
        scanning the whole region of north Africa, while there are some minor
        accomplishments, but still in the greater scale of things, north African
        accomplishments still mean nothing to the world. It appears that each
        country has its own issues and obstacles, but as divided we are, comes
        something that unites almost all of us which is TikTok, and other short
        social media outlets that attack the attention span to our brains.
      </p>
      <p>
        But wait! Looking into Africa, hey…! there is the greatest civilization
        “sorry China and Iraq” that is known by all mankind and probably the
        habitants of the galaxies if such thing exist! It’s EGYPT. Egypt has
        been ill for a really long time. Egypt started to be controlled by
        Egyptians, “whatever the word controlled really means!” in the early
        years of 1950’s after the 1952 coup conducted by the “Free Officers”
        against the family of Mohamed Ali’s reign since the age of the good old
        ancient Egyptians! Egypt has been like the student that never failed an
        exam but yet barely passes; therefore, no one really pays attention to
        that student. But what happened to Egypt to make it reach that point of
        being the not so smart student in the classroom. I have dedicated my
        time to learn, gather, and analyze the data for the my life span “1990’s
        up until 2019”, why 2019; well, 2019 is the last known “normal year”
        prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. That’s it!

        Egypt has been like the student that never failed an exam but yet barely
        passes; therefore, no one really pay attention to that student. But what
        happened to Egypt to make it reach that point of being the not so neat
        student in the classroom. I have dedicated some of my time to learn,
        gather, analyze the data for my life span “1990’s up until 2019”, why
        2019; well, 2019 is the last known “normal year” prior the covid-19
        pandemic. Now, the question is, why this long introduction, before I
        even jump into the topic of this essay? Well, the answer is that even
        though I am focusing my study on Egypt, still the world is a messy place
        and that neither Egypt is above criticism nor the rest of the world is
        perfect!
      </p>
      <p>
        Under President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's involvement in global affairs in
        1990 was significant, including joining forces against Saddam Hussein's
        invasion of Kuwait. It was also emerging from conflict with Israel over
        Sinai, and incidentally, the year my parents got married. To assess
        Egypt's current state, I used a substantial amount of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, let’s analyze the poverty levels in 1990 in Egypt. According to
        the world data bank, Egypt had a poverty level of 5.3% with a population
        of 57.2 million. Now Egypt is almost a perfect 1 million sq km, so while
        we are at it… each Egyptian had a 17,500 sq meters, that’s if Egyptians
        lived on 100% of Egypt’s land! By having the deltas for 1990, it leads
        us to discover that approx. there were 3 million people were considered
        poor in Egypt. Skipping 20 years and now we are in 2010; the poverty
        level was a 1% with population of 87.2 million Egyptians, which leaves
        each Egyptian with approximately 11,468 square meters per person, from
        the stats we can tell that there were approx. 1 million Egyptians
        considered poor. Reaching 2019, the poverty levels was at 1.5% with
        population of 105.6 million Egyptians, which is approximately 9,470
        square meters per person; the data leads that there were approx. 1.6
        million Egyptians considered poor. When placing this data into charts,
        we can discover that increased population does not necessarily trigger
        poverty and if anything, it actually pushes poverty downwards. The
        analysis also explains that China and India with their very high
        population and leading economies in the world today. Egypt only needs to
        allocate its man power accordingly and create more fair opportunities
        for its growing population to compete within and with the world
        economically. <Poverty /> <hr />
        <NumberPoor />
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, another point is to direct the population to better education,
        according to “Privacy Shield Framework” there are currently 52 million
        Egyptians are in schools and currently has around 58,807 schools. Egypt
        needs to at least triple this number of schools in order to provide a
        decent education system that would eventually contribute to its growth.
        Freeing students for the system that their final grades dictate which
        higher education they will peruse is creating a cluster of graduates in
        one or two fields while deserted in the other important fields as Egypt
        is in desperate need for diversified educated graduates to contribute to
        the potential growth.

        <GDP />
        Diving deeper into the economics of things in Egypt. Egypt’s GDP in 1990
        was $42.98 billion USD for its FY and to conduct a simple calculation, I
        am assuming a 0% inflation in the 1990 and as a result making the GDP
        per person in a month was at $62.5 which is well above the $2.15 per day
        as Poverty defined by the UN, but still $62.5 per month can’t provide a
        decent living in the 1990’s. you want to know the catch….well, the catch
        is the $62.5 GDP per person is not the net GDP! In order to come up with
        the net GDP, a calculation is still needed and a must which is adjusting
        the numbers after the national debt is removed from the math! A person’s
        share of debt in 1990 was at $33, which means the net GDP per person was
        at $14.46 per month… truly no comment!{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Data for 2010 shows that the adjusted to inflation GDP in Egypt was
        106.96 billion USD which translates to GDP per person of $102.3 and
        following the same methodology used above makes the net GDP per person
        at $67.17 after deducting the fair share of debt for each person of
        $36.8 per person. Reaching 2019, Egypt’s adjusted to inflation GDP was
        at 154.46 billion USD making the GDP per person at $121.81 per month
        with debt of $114.5 per person, leaving a net GDP per person at $31.46
        per month in a very obvious n shape turn of events. The economics
        numbers explain the devastation Egyptians currently are living in.

        As I believe of being part of the solution rather than being part of the
        problem and to drift away from being a dreamer or becoming overacting
        with revolutionary quotes from the greats! Economics are easily to be
        turned around by the power of well! Making a level playing field for
        investors and entrepreneurs to compete in Egypt is nothing but more
        strength to Egypt. Having the government involvements in business
        unfortunately kills competition as no private investor will get 1% of
        the privileges the government grant to itself! Improving small to
        mid-size businesses can act as a backbone of the economy as they will
        always be local and never act a hot money investor leave when things
        start getting rocky. As I don’t recommend tax breaks or special deals,
        as they are signs of weak and desperate economies. Also, the socialistic
        mentality will never work in today’s capitalistic world.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I could write another 1444 words on the importance of Capitalism, but I
        chose not to, so take my word for it or not, Capitalism is good… No pun
        intended!
